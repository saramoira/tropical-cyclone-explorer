# Tropical Cyclone Explorer

## Question/need:
### What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?

My goal is to build a simple tool to browse both current and former tropical cyclone information (with a particular focus on storm imagery from satellites). 

### Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?

Anyone who is curious about tropical cyclones and wants to find data by year/storm.

## Data Description:
### What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?

For this project I plan to use the [GOES-16 satellite data hosted on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-goes/), selected and processed to be storm-specific. I also plan on using similar data from [Himawari-8](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-himawari/) to show current active storms. 

I may also be using the [NHC storm discussion database](https://ftp.nhc.noaa.gov/atcf/archive/MESSAGES/2012/dis/) if time permits. 

### If modeling, what will you predict as your target?

If time permits after the initial proof of concept, I would like to incorporate my tropical cyclone topic model to offer a tool to find similar storms/data. 

## Tools:
### How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?

I plan to use Flask to build a web app and AWS for data management. Iâ€™ll be using sqlite3 as a database for the proof of concept app.

### Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?

I plan on using [metpy](https://unidata.github.io/MetPy/latest/index.html) and [satpy](https://satpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) libraries to process the NetCDF files from each satellite.

## MVP Goal:
### What would a minimum viable product (MVP) look like for this project?

A simple browser that allows the user to view infrared and visible satellite images/loops for approximately 10 storms, along with storm strength and discussion data.
